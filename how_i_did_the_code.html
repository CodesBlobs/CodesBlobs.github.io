    <h1>Challenges I Faced Making the Game</h1>

    <p>
        When I was making my matching games, I ran into a bunch of problems. The cards kept getting super big on my computer and tiny on my phone, so I had to figure out how to make them look good for both. The emojis were all over the place! Sometimes they were under the logo, sometimes they lined up like a boring row, and I just wanted them to circle around the logo. That took forever to fix.
    </p>

    <p>
        The background image didnâ€™t fill the screen on my phone at first, which was super annoying. The cards were way too big, and the words looked fat, so I had to shrink them and make the fonts fit better. I also wanted the emojis bigger than the words but still fit on the cards, and I wanted the start button to play a sound, which took me a while to figure out.
    </p>

    <p>
        Making the matching logic work was tricky too. I had to make sure two cards matched before showing a message and playing a sound, and if they didnâ€™t, they had to flip back. Plus, making everything move nicely and not break when you click too fast was really hard. But I didnâ€™t give up! I kept trying different ideas, fixing the circle, and making the cards scale, and finally it all works now. Itâ€™s still not perfect, but itâ€™s way better than before.
