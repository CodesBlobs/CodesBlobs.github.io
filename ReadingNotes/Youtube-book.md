## Chapter 8 Fixing it in Post: The Edit
1. The tools on macOS and Windows for video editing aren't the same:
    1. For macOS there are iMovie, QuickTimePlayer, Camtasia, Final CutPro and CapCut which is sooo caaapppp
    2. For Windows there are Adobe Premiere, Vegas, Pinacle Studio, CyberLink PowerDiretor and OpenShot.
2. Trimming videos are very important, because people don't want to    watch boring parts of the video (eg: loading screens or a "You don't know what you're doing").
3. Inserting an image or another video will be useful if you want to make a funny image pop up, which makes the video more exciting.
4. Give an answer to why you should `like` and `Subscribe` this video so
the viewer does know when your new videos are coming.
